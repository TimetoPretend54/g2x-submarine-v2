# Each game controller axis returns a value in the closed interval [-1, 1]. We
# limit the number of decimal places we use with the PRECISION constant. This is
# done for a few reasons: 1) it makes the numbers more human-friendly (easier to
# read) and 2) it reduces the number of thruster updates.
#
# To elaborate on this last point, I was seeing a lot of very small fluctations
# with the values coming from my PS4 controller. The change in values were so
# small, they effectively would not change the current thruster value. By
# reducing the precision, these very small fluctuations get filtered out,
# resulting in fewer thruster updates. Also, I found that when I let go of a
# joystick, the value would hover around 0.0 but would never actually become
# zero. This means the thrusters would always be active, consuming battery power
# unnecessarily. Again, by limiting the precision, these small fluctuations were
# filtered out resulting in consistent zero values when then joysticks were in
# their resting positions.
#
# Using three digits of precisions was an arbitrary choice that just happened to
# work the first time. If we find that we need more fine control of the
# thrusters, we may need to increase this value.
PRECISION = 3

# NOTE: For some reason the same controller does not return the same axes
# numbers on macOS and Raspian, so we adjust these constants per OS so that the
# server will get consistent axis numbers. This has only been tested on macOS
