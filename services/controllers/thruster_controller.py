# Each game controller axis returns a value in the closed interval [-1, 1]. We
# limit the number of decimal places we use with the PRECISION constant. This is
# done for a few reasons: 1) it makes the numbers more human-friendly (easier to
# read) and 2) it reduces the number of thruster updates.
#
# To elaborate on this last point, I was seeing a lot of very small fluctations
# with the values coming from my PS4 controller. The change in values were so
# small, they effectively would not change the current thruster value. By
# reducing the precision, these very small fluctuations get filtered out,
# resulting in fewer thruster updates. Also, I found that when I let go of a
# joystick, the value would hover around 0.0 but would never actually become
# zero. This means the thrusters would always be active, consuming battery power
# unnecessarily. Again, by limiting the precision, these small fluctuations were
# filtered out resulting in consistent zero values when then joysticks were in
# their resting positions.
#
# Using three digits of precisions was an arbitrary choice that just happened to
# work the first time. If we find that we need more fine control of the
# thrusters, we may need to increase this value.

        '''
        This is the main method of this class. It is responsible for taking an
        controller input value (referred to as an axis value) and then
        converting that into the appropriate thrust values for the appropriate
        thrusters associated with that axis.

        For the twpro joysticks, we convert the joystick position into an angle.
        We know which thrusters each joystick controls, so we feed the
        calculated angle into the thruster interpolators for that joystick. This
        gives us the new thruster value for each thruster, which we then apply
        to the PWM controller devices for those thrusters.

        Note that the angle of the joystick does not give us all of the
        information that we need. If the joystick is close to the center
        position, then we don't need to apply as much thrust. If it is pushed
        all the way to the edge, then we nee 100% thrust. So, we treat the
        center as 0% and the edge as 100%. The values we get back from the
        interpolators are 100% values, so we simply apply the joystick
        percentage to the interpolator value to find the actual thrust value we
        need to use.

        Things get a bit more complicated for the vertical thrusters because it
        is possible that we will be pitiching or rolling the vehicle while
        simultaneously trying to move the vehicle directly up or down. If we
        pitch or roll the vehicle only, then the process is exactly as we
        described above. However, if are pithing and/or rolling AND moveing the
        vehicle vertically, we need to combine the two operations into one set
        of thruster values. We have to first determine the values for pitch and
        roll, then we increase or decrease all thruster values equally in the up
        or down direction. However it is possible that we will not be able to
        increase/decrease all thrusters by the same amount since we are already
        applying thrust for pitch and roll. This means we need to make sure our
        values do not go outside the closed intervale [-1,1]. This means that as
        we pitch or roll harder, the vehical will flattern out as we apply
        vertical thrust.
